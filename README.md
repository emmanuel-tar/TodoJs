## 1.1 How to create Header

This code snippet appears to be sorting an array of items based on their completion status and description, then updating the HTML content with the sorted items.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The sortItems function is defined, which takes an array of items as an argument.
The items array is sorted using the sort method. The sorting criteria is based on the completed property of each item. If a.completed is true, it returns 1, otherwise it returns -1 if b.completed is true. If both a.completed and b.completed are false, it compares the description property of both items using the < operator and returns -1 or 1 accordingly. This ensures that completed items appear after incomplete items, and within each group, items are sorted alphabetically by their description.
The ITEMS_CONTAINER HTML element is cleared of any existing content.
A for loop iterates over the sorted items array.
For each item, a new itemElement is created by cloning a template element (ITEMS_TEMPLATE).
The descriptionInput and completedInput elements are selected from the itemElement using the querySelector method.
The descriptionInput value is set to the description property of the current item, and the completedInput checked property is set to the completed property of the current item.
An event listener is added to the descriptionInput element, which listens for change events. When a change occurs, the updateItem function is called with the current item, the string "description", and the new value of the descriptionInput as arguments.
In summary, this code sorts an array of items based on their completion status and description, then updates the HTML content with the sorted items. It also adds event listeners to each item's description input field, which call the updateItem function when a change occurs.
